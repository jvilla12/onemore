HISTORY
Like many great stories this one started with an idea, with the enthusiasm and with the work (and lots of it) of one man - Horst Tubbesing. Horst recognised the difficulty encountered by many talented artists in obtaining recording contracts; so starting out in Germany, originally with a few vinyl recordings to suit the needs of touring artists from Bolivia, he founded the label 'Eulenspiegel' (this is where the EU of our album product numbers comes from and our logo of the winking owl with a mirror – Eulenspiegel literally means “Owl’s Mirror”).</p>
